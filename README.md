# make-taxonomy
I work on hierarchical text classification and I found a dataset with three different label levels.
For a project, I need to extract labels in hierarchical taxonomy form for this reason I wrote this code to extract what I need.
If your dataset has more level than mine usage you can change the "depth" in the code and after that use the code for your own dataset
